'mvn install' or 'mvn test' should do the trick (if you have maven 2 installed!).


-- Running the specs: 
Cucumber features and cuke4duke execution is handled in the maven pom. To run features do:
# Bootstrapping the system (only needed the first time, but it will take a while to download an install): 
mvn -Dcucumber.installGems=true integration-test
mvn integration-test   // For all tests to run (also needed to compile everything, at least the first time)
mvn cuke4duke:cucumber // To run just cucumber features

-- If you are behind a proxy, please modify the pom file accordingly (search for 'behind a proxy' for instructions in the file).

Cucumber features are stored in the features folder.
Step definitions are stored in the test folder, stepdefinitions package.
